# Installing and Configuring Jupyter

## Required packages

* apt-get -y install npm nodejs

## Setting up Anaconda

* [download link](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
* ``` chmod +x Anaconda3-5.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh && ./Anaconda3-5.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh```
  * Installation path (PREFIX): **/usr/local/anaconda3**

## Setting up global paths so everyone has access to custom installations

File: **/etc/profile.d/jupyter_env.sh**

```shell
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/anaconda3/bin:/usr/local/cling/bin
```

## Jupyter, JupyterLab, JupyterHub

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterhub notebook jupyterlab
```

### JupyterHub Setup

#### Create directory and initial config file

```shell
mkdir /usr/local/jupyterhub
cd /usr/local/jupyterhub
jupyterhub --generate-config
#This should create a file called jupyterhub_config.py in the directory
```

#### Create self-signed certificates

```shell
mkdir /usr/local/jupyterhub/cert
cd /usr/local/jupyterhub/cert
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout mykey.key -out mycert.pem
```

### Make sure users have a folder to run jupyter

```shell
# If there are any existing users from before - they will have to manually create a jupyter folder in their home directory: this will only create the folder for new users
mkdir /etc/skel/jupyter
```

#### Non-default parameters in config file

Modify the config file you generated earlier: **/usr/local/jupyterhub/jupyterhub_config.py**, and update the following parameters:

```
c.JupyterHub.port = 443
c.JupyterHub.ssl_cert = '/usr/local/jupyterhub/cert/mycert.pem'
c.JupyterHub.ssl_key = '/usr/local/jupyterhub/cert/mykey.key'
c.Spawner.default_url = '/lab'
c.Spawner.disable_user_config = True
c.Spawner.notebook_dir = '~/jupyter'
```

### Start JupyterHub (from gnu-screen, as root)

```shell
cd /usr/local/jupyterhub
jupyterhub
```

### Launch jupyterhub from your browser

* Open the url: https://<your_server_ip> - you should be able to login using your unix credentials.  At this moment - you should have python3 available.

# Installing a Python2 kernel

```shell
conda create -n ipykernel_py2 python=2 ipykernel
source activate ipykernel_py2
python -m ipykernel install
```



# Installing a CLING kernel

## Required Packages

- apt-get install -y g++ gcc libboost-all-dev

## Get cling binaries from root.cern.ch

- [download link](https://root.cern.ch/download/cling/)
- Extract binaries (I used [this version](https://root.cern.ch/download/cling/cling_2017-11-13_ubuntu16.tar.bz2)) to **/usr/local/cling\_2017-11-13\_ubuntu16, and symlinked **/usr/local/cling** to point to it.

## Install cling kernel

```shell
cd /usr/local/cling_2017-11-13_ubuntu16/share/cling/Jupyter/kernel
jupyter-kernelspec install  cling-cpp11
jupyter-kernelspec install  cling-cpp14
jupyter-kernelspec install  cling-cpp17
```

Now: you should have access to c++11, 14, and 17 kernels.

# Installing an Octave Kernel

## Required packages

- apt-get install -y octave gnuplot

## Install the kernel

```shell
pip install octave_kernel
```

You should now have an octave kernel

# Installing a Ruby Kernel

## Required Packages:

* apt-get -y install libtool libffi-dev ruby ruby-dev make
* apt-get -y install libzmq3-dev libczmq-dev

```shell
gem install cztop iruby
iruby register --force
# At this point: jupyter kernelspec list shows the kernel in:
# /root/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/ruby - if needed: copy this to:
# /usr/local/anaconda3/share/jupyter/kernels
```



# Installing a Go Kernel 

**Only works with classic JupyterHub, not JupyterLab**.  Trying Fabian's  gopherlab had issues with zmq libraries... so I'm switching to the default gophernotes instead.

## Required Packages:

* apt-get -y install golang

### Some customizations

Since we are installing as root for all users: I'm setting up my root GOPATH to point to /usr/local/src/go:

```shell
cat << EOF >> ~/.bashrc
export GOPATH=/usr/local/src/go
EOF
. ~/.bashrc && mkdir -p $GOPATH
```

Setting up gophernotes

```shell
go get -u github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes
cp $GOPATH/bin/gophernotes /usr/local/bin
mkdir /usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/gophernotes
cp $GOPATH/src/github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes/kernel/* /usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/gophernotes
```

You should see the new go kernel now, but it will only work with classic Jupyter, not Jupyterlab.

Gopherlab for Jupyterlab: even when installed, has issues with output (things visible at first glance) - so I'll be switching to classic view for go notebooks.

# Installing a Clojure Kernel

Install Lein

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein
chmod +x lein && mv lein /usr/local/bin
```

Install the kernel locally

```shell
cd /usr/local/src
git clone https://github.com/roryk/clojupyter
cd clojupyter
make
make install
```

Move the kernel and binary to /usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels

```shell
mkdir -p /usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/clojure/bin
mv ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/clojure/clojupyter /usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/clojure/bin
mv ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/clojure/kernel.json /usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/clojure
```

update the kernel.json file that has the connection file specified to say:

```shell
"argv": ["bash", "/usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/clojure/bin/clojupyter", "{connection_file}"],

```
