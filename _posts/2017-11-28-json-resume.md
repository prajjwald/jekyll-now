# Documentation

[Wiki](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-docs/wiki)

From the Wiki:

* **Schema** <https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema>
* **Client** <https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli>
* **Server** <https://github.com/jsonresume/registry-server>



* All the actual conversions are done by the server component, not the client.
* The only exception is when using `resume serve`
